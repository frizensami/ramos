Boot Sequence on OSDev: https://wiki.osdev.org/Boot_Sequence

Following tutorial: https://wiki.osdev.org/User:Zesterer/Bare_Bones

What we are building
- Simple kernel that just prints text on the screen
- Target: x86 arch
- We will use GRUB to load the kernel into memory for use
- GRUB will also set up protected mode for us
    - Interestingly, GRUB does this for other OSs, but not for Linux
    - GRUB RUNS in protected mode, but switches back to Real before booting kernel (for Linux)

Step 1: Build GCC Cross Compiler for i686-elf (https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)
- I am on Linux, and have most of the EXECUTABLES required (gcc, etc)
- I need to download a bunch of SOURCE CODE that we need to compile for a different arch
    - I needed to download GCC and Binutils source code
    - Rest of the executables (GNU GMP, MPFR...) were already installed
- Follow instructions to build binutils, then gcc. New gcc/binutils needs to be added to the path as said in tutorial.

Step 2: Understanding "Freestanding"
- Writing "freestanding" code. We don't have access to a lot of things that are normally available to C code when it's written inside an OS (files, printf, etc). Only have basic GCC headers. 

Our project structure:
1. start.s    --> x86 assembly, starts our kernel, sets up x86 environment
2. kernel.c   --> our actual kernel that runs after being called by start.s
3. linker.ld  --> tells our compiler how to create the kernel executable

Most of the work here involved writing code to output to the terminal, and getting atoi/itoa to work
to convert integers to strings.

I allowed the text on screen to scroll - just move all the lines up by 1.

I also experimented with loading certain registers DIRECTLY as variables. This works, surprisingly, but is also dangerous. Modifying %esp when it is mapped to a variable causes a crash of QEMU. 
But it also works as expected. Printing eax initially gives 0, but after a function returns 5, it displays as 5 afterwards. Very interesting, but expected.

Now, to get the memory available by the system, we need to use the Multiboot scheme to get information from the BIOS that the kernel cannot get by itself. By pushing eax and ebx onto the stack before calling the kernel main function in start.s, we can receive a lot of information from the BIOS. This is part of the Multiboot specification.

Multiboot memory: Lower - 639, Upper - 129920
What do these numbers mean? 
https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html says:
1. mem_lower indicates AMOUNT of LOWER MEMORY available in kilobytes [639 kilobytes in our case]
--> Max value is supposedly 640 kilobytes (why?)
In contrast, the last 384 kB of
lower memory was not backed by RAM, but rather reserved for video memory,
memory mapped I/O, and the BIOS ROM. In real mode, this reserved
area appears at the top of the real mode address space. However in protected
mode, the reserved area forms a memory hole between 640 kB and 1 MB that
must not be disturbed (except for video memory) by either the bootloader or
the operating system -- https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410-s07/p4/p4-boot.pdf
--> Start at address 0
2. mem_upper indicates AMOUNT of UPPER MEMORY available in kilobytes [129920 kilobytes in our case]
--> Starts at address 1MB
--> QEMU default is 128 MB of RAM 
--> IF i set -m switch on QEMU to 1G (1GB of RAM) --> higher/upper val is now: 1047424 kilobytes
--> Specifically: 1047424 KiB is 0.998... GiB. Why isn't this 1GB?



Makefile creation: https://wiki.osdev.org/Makefile, https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=23472
- DO NOT include *.c files after starting to use headers. Causes pain due to multiple definitions.
